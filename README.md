# VideoStream

Video chat room app

video - implemented
text chat - implemented
audio - not implemented

The ip addresses in the client js file are hard coded and need to be changed in order for the web app to function properly.

The server's IP needs to be public or the server needs to be in the same LAN with the PCs joining the video chat room.

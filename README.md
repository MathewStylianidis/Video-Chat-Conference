# Video chat conference

video - implemented

text chat - implemented

audio - not implemented

The server's IP needs to be public or the server needs to be in the same LAN with the PCs joining the video chat room.

The IP addresses in the client js file are hard coded and need to be changed in order for the web app to function properly.

For the moment the app contains only one room. However, adding more should be trivial.
